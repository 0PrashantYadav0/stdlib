## Git

*   All commits should follow the [seven rules][git-seven-rules] of a `git` commit message:
    1.   Use the [imperative mood][imperative-mood] in the `git` commit subject line.
    1.   Capitalize the first word of the subject line.
    1.   Do __not__ end the subject line with a period.
    1.   Separate the subject line from the body with a blank line.
    1.   Try to limit the subject line to `50` characters.
    1.   Use the body to explain the *what* and *why*, and not the *how*.
    1.   Try to wrap the body at `72` characters.
