# Prints the number of merges per day.

# <month> <day> <year> <number_of_merges>

# * `git log --reverse --merges`
#   - Show commit logs in reverse order.
# * `grep Date`
#   - Extract the line which begins with `Date` from each log.
# * `awk '{}'
#   - From each date line, extract the month (`$3`), day (`$4`), and year (`$6`).
# * `uniq -c`
#   - Given that same day commits are on consecutive lines, we can remove repeated lines and count the repeats to show daily totals.
# * `awk '{}'`
#   - Format the output.
