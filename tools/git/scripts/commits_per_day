# Prints the number of commits per day.

# * `git log --reverse`
#   - Show commit logs in reverse order.
# * `grep Date`
#   - Extract the line which begins with `Date` from each log.
# * `awk '{}'
#   - From each date line, extract the month (`$3`), day (`$4`), and year (`$6`).
# * `uniq -c`
#   - Given that same day commits are on consecutive lines, we can remove repeated lines and count the repeats to show daily totals.
