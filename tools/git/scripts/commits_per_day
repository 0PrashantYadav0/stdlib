# Prints the number of commits per day.

# <month> <day> <year> <number_of_commits>

# * `git log --reverse`
#   - Show commit logs in reverse order.
# * `grep '^Date'`
#   - Extract the line which begins with `Date` from each log.
# * `awk '{}'
#   - From each date line, extract the month (`$3`), day (`$4`), and year (`$6`).
# * `sort -k1n -k2M -k3n`
#   - Sort the year numerically, sort the second key as a month, and sort the day numerically.
# * `uniq -c`
#   - Given that same day commits are on consecutive lines, we can remove repeated lines and count the repeats to show daily totals.
# * `awk '{}'`
#   - Format the output.
