### C

> **Note**: C benchmark recipes delegate to local Makefiles which are responsible for actually compiling and running the respective benchmarks.

#### benchmark-c

Runs C benchmarks.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-c
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **BENCHMARKS_FILTER**: filepath pattern; e.g., `.*/blas/base/dasum/.*`.
-   **BLAS**: BLAS library name; e.g., `openblas`.
-   **BLAS_DIR**: BLAS directory.
-   **C_COMPILER**: C compiler; e.g., `gcc`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to glob for C benchmark files (e.g., run all C benchmarks for a particular package).

#### benchmark-c-files

Runs a specified list of C benchmark files.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-c-files FILES='/foo/benchmark.c /bar/benchmark.c'
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of C benchmark files.
-   **BLAS**: BLAS library name; e.g., `openblas`.
-   **BLAS_DIR**: BLAS directory.
-   **C_COMPILER**: C compiler; e.g., `gcc`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to run a list of C benchmark files generated by some other command (e.g., a filtered list of changed C benchmark files obtained via `git diff`).

* * *

### C++

> **Note**: C++ benchmark recipes delegate to local Makefiles which are responsible for actually compiling and running the respective benchmarks.

#### benchmark-cpp

Runs C++ benchmarks.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-cpp
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **BENCHMARKS_FILTER**: filepath pattern; e.g., `.*/blas/base/dasum/.*`.
-   **CXX_COMPILER**: C++ compiler; e.g., `g++`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to glob for C++ benchmark files (e.g., run all C++ benchmarks for a particular package).

#### benchmark-cpp-files

Runs a specified list of C++ benchmark files.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-cpp-files FILES='/foo/benchmark.cpp /bar/benchmark.cpp'
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of C++ benchmark files.
-   **CXX_COMPILER**: C++ compiler; e.g., `g++`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to run a list of C++ benchmark files generated by some other command (e.g., a filtered list of changed C++ benchmark files obtained via `git diff`).

### Fortran

> **Note**: Fortran benchmark recipes delegate to local Makefiles which are responsible for actually compiling and running the respective benchmarks.

#### benchmark-fortran

Runs Fortran benchmarks.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-fortran
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **BENCHMARKS_FILTER**: filepath pattern; e.g., `.*/blas/base/dasum/.*`.
-   **FORTRAN_COMPILER**: Fortran compiler; e.g., `gfortran`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to glob for Fortran benchmark files (e.g., run all Fortran benchmarks for a particular package).

#### benchmark-fortran-files

Runs a specified list of Fortran benchmark files.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-fortran-files FILES='/foo/benchmark.f /bar/benchmark.f'
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of Fortran benchmark files.
-   **FORTRAN_COMPILER**: Fortran compiler; e.g., `gfortran`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to run a list of Fortran benchmark files generated by some other command (e.g., a filtered list of changed Fortran benchmark files obtained via `git diff`).

* * *

### JavaScript

#### benchmark-javascript

Runs JavaScript benchmarks.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-javascript
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **BENCHMARKS_FILTER**: filepath pattern; e.g., `.*/blas/base/dasum/.*`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to glob for JavaScript benchmark files (e.g., run all JavaScript benchmarks for a particular package).

#### benchmark-javascript-files

Runs a specified list of JavaScript benchmark files.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-javascript-files FILES='/foo/benchmark.js /bar/benchmark.js'
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of JavaScript benchmark files.

This recipe is useful when wanting to run a list of JavaScript benchmark files generated by some other command (e.g., a filtered list of changed JavaScript benchmark files obtained via `git diff`).

* * *

### Julia

#### benchmark-julia

Runs Julia benchmarks.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-julia
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **BENCHMARKS_FILTER**: filepath pattern; e.g., `.*/blas/base/dasum/.*`.

This recipe is useful when wanting to glob for Julia benchmark files (e.g., run all Julia benchmarks for a particular package).

#### benchmark-julia-files

Runs a specified list of Julia benchmark files.

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-julia-files FILES='/foo/benchmark.jl /bar/benchmark.jl'
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **FILES**: list of Julia benchmark files.

This recipe is useful when wanting to run a list of Julia benchmark files generated by some other command (e.g., a filtered list of changed Julia benchmark files obtained via `git diff`).

* * *

<!-- run-disable -->

```bash
$ make benchmark-python
```

The recipe recognizes the following environment variables:

-   **BENCHMARKS_FILTER**: filepath pattern; e.g., `.*/blas/base/dasum/.*`.
