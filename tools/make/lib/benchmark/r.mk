# Runs R benchmarks consecutively.

# ## Notes
#
# -   The recipe assumes that benchmark files can be run via R.
# -   This rule is useful when wanting to glob for R benchmark files (e.g., run all R benchmarks for a particular package).

# Runs a specified list of R benchmarks consecutively.

# ## Notes
#
# -   The recipe assumes that benchmark files can be run via R.
