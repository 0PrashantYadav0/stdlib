<section class="intro">

This directory contains distributable files for use in browser environments. Each distributable is a standalone [UMD][umd] bundle which, if no recognized module system is present, will expose bundle contents to the global scope.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/<bundle>.js"></script>
```

For example, to include the main un-minified bundle exposing a flat namespace

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/stdlib-flat.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope. For example, assuming a flat namespace bundle,

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    // `stdlib` is a global variable...
    var erf = stdlib.erf;
    console.log( erf( 0.5 ) );
</script>
```

## Notes

-   Bundles are one of two namespace types: `flat` or `tree`. A `tree` namespace is a nested object namespace which mirrors the project's layout (e.g., `stdlib.math.base.special.erf`. A `flat` namespace uses the global alias namespace, where each package has a unique alias (e.g., `stdlib.base.erf`). Which namespace is preferred depends on personal taste and application context.
-   Each minified bundle has a corresponding [gzip][gzip]-compressed bundle. The [gzip][gzip] compression level for each compressed bundle is `9`, which is the highest (and most optimal) compression level. Deciding between uncompressed and compressed bundles depends on the application and whether compression is handled elsewhere in the application stack (e.g., [nginx][nginx], [CDN][cdn], _et cetera_).
