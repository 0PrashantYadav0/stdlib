The privacy policy at <https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/PRIVACY.md> ("Privacy Policy") describes these policies. The Project will abide by the Privacy Policy and agrees to honor user privacy settings as pertains to Services.

Use of all Services is governed by a code of conduct at <https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md> ("Code of Conduct").

## Disclaimers

**Disclaimer of Warranty**. Use of Services is at your sole risk and discretion. Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. The Project expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of security, availability, title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose. The Project makes no warranty that Services will meet your requirements, operate in an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free manner, or that errors in Services will be corrected.

**Limitation of Liability**. The Project will not be liable to you for any damages that arise from your using the Services. This includes if the Services are hacked or unavailable. This includes all of types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary). And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort (including negligence, product liability, or otherwise), or any other pecuniary loss, and whether or not the Project has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

**Third Party Services**. Services may hyperlink to and integrate with third-party applications, websites, and other services. You decide whether and how to use and interact with such services. The Project does not make any warranty regarding such services or content they may provide, and will not be liable to you for any damages related to such services. Use of such third-party services may be governed by other terms and privacy notices that are not part of these Terms and are not controlled by the Project.

**No Waiver**. Neither the exercise of any right under these Terms, nor waiver of any breach of these Terms, waives any other breach of these Terms.

**Severability**. If any provision of these Terms is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, you agree that the court should try to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect.

**Choice of Law and Jurisdiction**. These Terms are governed by California law, without reference to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that any suit arising from the Services must take place in a court located in San Francisco, California.

**Entire agreement**. These Terms (including any document incorporated by reference into them) are the whole agreement between the Project and you concerning the Services. These Terms supersede any other agreements about Services, written or not.
