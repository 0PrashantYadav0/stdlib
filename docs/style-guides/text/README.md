# Style Guide

> Style guide for writing text.

-   Filenames should be lowercase. Some top-level files and all `README.md` files are exceptions.

-   Filenames should be snake_case.

-   Use American English spelling; e.g., "Capitalize" vs. "Capitalise", "color" vs. "colour", etc.

-   Insofar as is possible, spelling and grammar issues should be identified using tools, and, if not caught by a tool, should be identified by human reviewers.

-   Use the [Oxford comma][oxford-comma] for clarity.

-   Avoid using personal pronouns in reference documentation (e.g., "I", "you", "we").

-   Personal pronouns are acceptable in more colloquial documentation, such as guides.

-   Prefer using gender-neutral pronouns and mass nouns. For example,

    -   **OK**: "one", "they", "their", "them", "people", "developers"
    -   **NOT OK**: "his", "him", "guys"

    Exclusive use of female pronoun forms is permitted.

-   Place end-of-sentence punctuation inside wrapping elements; e.g., periods should be placed inside parentheses and quotes, not after.

-   Markdown documents must start with a level-one heading, such as in this document.

-   Use definitions rather than in-lining; e.g., prefer `[link][]` over `[link](http://example.com)`.

-   References to constructor functions should use PascalCase.

-   References to constructor instances should use camelCase.

-   References to functions and methods should use parentheses; e.g., `foo.factory()` versus `foo.factory`.
