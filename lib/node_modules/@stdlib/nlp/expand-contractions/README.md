## Usage

```

#### expandContractions( str )

Expands all contractions to their formal equivalents.

var out = expandContractions( str );
// returns 'I will not be able to get you all out of this one.'
```

## Notes

-   This expansion is done via a simple table look-up. Hence, it will not correctly replace contractions for which there are multiple possible expansions such as `"She'd"`, which can be expanded to both `"She would"` or `"She had"`. In such cases, the package expands to a chosen default, in the given example `"She would"`. Should you desire higher accuracy, consider using a fully-fledged NLP disambiguation algorithm for English contractions.
