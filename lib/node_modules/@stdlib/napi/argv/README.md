## Usage

```c
#include "stdlib/napi/argv.h"
```

#### STDLIB_NAPI_ARGV( env, info, argv, argc, nargs )

Macro for retrieving add-on callback arguments.

```c
#include <node_api.h>

// ...

static napi_value addon( napi_env env, napi_callback_info info ) {
    // Retrieve callback arguments:
    STDLIB_STRIDED_NAPI_ARGV( env, info, argv, argc, 6 );

    // ...
}
```

The macro expects the following arguments:

-   **env**: environment under which the callback is invoked.
-   **info**: callback data.
-   **argv**: variable name for storing argument values.
-   **argc**: variable name for storing the number of provided arguments.
-   **nargs**: expected number of arguments.
