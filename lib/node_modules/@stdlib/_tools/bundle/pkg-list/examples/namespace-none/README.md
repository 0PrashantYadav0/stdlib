# Example

> Generate a [browserify][browserify] bundle where bundled packages must be required individually.

<!-- Section to include introductory text. Make sure to keep an empty line after the intro `section` element and another before the `/section` close. -->

<section class="intro">

To run the example, in your terminal, navigate to this directory

```bash
$ cd /path/to/this/directory
```

Once in the directory, generate the minified bundle

```bash
$ node ./index.js
```

Next, launch a static file server

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHttpServer <port>
```

where `<port>` is the server port (e.g., `7331`). Finally, to view the example in a local web browser, navigate to

```text
http://127.0.0.1:<port>
```
