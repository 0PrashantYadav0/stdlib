// MAIN //

/**
* Runs a function on a subsequent turn of the event loop.
*
* ## Notes
*
* * `process.nextTick` is only Node.js.
* * `setImmediate` is non-standard.
* * Everything else is browser based (e.g., mutation observer, requestAnimationFrame, etc).
* * Only API which is universal is `setTimeout`.
* * Note that `0` is not actually `0ms`. Browser environments commonly have a minimum delay of `4ms`. This is acceptable. Here, the main intent of this function is to give the runtime a chance to run garbage collection, clear state, and tend to any other pending tasks before returning control to benchmark tasks. The larger aim (attainable or not) is to provide each benchmark run with as much of a fresh state as possible.
