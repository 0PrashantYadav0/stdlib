# Named Typed Tuple

> Create a factory for generating named typed tuples.

<!-- Section to include introductory text. Make sure to keep an empty line after the intro `section` element and another before the `/section` close. -->

<section class="intro">

Named tuples assign a property name, and thus a meaning, to each position in a tuple and allow for more readable, self-documenting code.

Named typed tuples can be used wherever [typed arrays][@stdlib/array/typed] are used, with the added benefit that they allow accessing fields by both field name and position index.

<!-- /.intro -->

<!-- Package usage documentation. -->

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var namedtypedtuple = require( '@stdlib/utils/named-typed-tuple' );
```

<a name="main"></a>

#### namedtypedtuple( fields\[, options] )

Returns a named typed tuple factory.

```javascript
var factory = namedtypedtuple( [ 'x', 'y' ] );

var tuple = factory( [ 1.0, -1.0 ] );
```

The function accepts the following `options`:

-   **dtype**: default tuple data type. If a data type is not provided to a named typed tuple factory, this option specifies the underlying tuple data type. The following data types are supported:

    -   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754).
    -   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754).
    -   `int32`: 32-bit two's complement signed integers.
    -   `uint32`: 32-bit unsigned integers.
    -   `int16`: 16-bit two's complement signed integers.
    -   `uint16`: 16-bit unsigned integers.
    -   `int8`: 8-bit two's complement signed integers.
    -   `uint8`: 8-bit unsigned integers.
    -   `uint8c`: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255.

    Default: `'float64'`.

-   **name**: tuple name. Default: `'tuple'`.

## Notes

-   Named typed tuples are **not** immutable. In order to create immutable named typed tuples, use `Object.freeze()` on returned tuples.

    <!-- TODO: use stdlib `Object.freeze` package -->

    ```javascript
    var factory = namedtypedtuple( [ 'x', 'y' ] );

    var tuple = factory( [ 1.0, -1.0 ] );

    // Make the tuple immutable:
    tuple = Object.freeze( tuple );
    ```

<section class="examples">

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var namedtypedtuple = require( '@stdlib/utils/named-typed-tuple' );

var fields = [ 'x', 'y' ];
var opts = {
    'name': 'Point'
};

var Point = namedtypedtuple( fields, opts );

var p = new Point( [ 1.0, -1.0 ] );

// Tuple elements can be accessed by index or name:
var x = p[ 0 ];
// returns 1.0

x = p.x;
// returns 1.0

var y = p[ 1 ];
// returns -1.0

y = p.y;
// returns -1.0

// Sort tuple elements while retaining name access:
p.sort();
console.log( 'p[0]=%d, p[1]=%d, x=%d, y=%d', p[ 0 ], p[ 1 ], p.x, p.y );

// Retrieve the tuple fields in index order:
console.log( p.orderedFields );
// => [ 'y', 'x' ]

// Serialize the tuple as a string:
console.log( p.toString() );

// Serialize the tuple a JSON string:
console.log( JSON.stringify( p ) );
```
