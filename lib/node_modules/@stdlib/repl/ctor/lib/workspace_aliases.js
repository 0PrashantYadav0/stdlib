/*
* List of workspace API aliases and corresponding argument completion compatibility.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Each entry in the list has the following format:
*
*     ```
*     [ <alias>, <completion_flag>, ... ]
*     ```
*
*     where `<alias>` is a workspace API alias and `<completion_flag>` is an `integer` indicating whether an argument is compatible with workspace name or variable completion.
*
* -   Completion flags:
*
*     -   `0`: non-completable
*     -   `1`: workspace name
*     -   `2`: workspace variable
*
* -   For the purposes of TAB completion, only those positional arguments which expect workspace names or variables need to be included. For example, if an API has three parameters and only the first argument expects either a workspace name or variable, only that first argument needs to be included below; the remaining two arguments can be omitted, as those arguments are assumed to be incompatible with workspace name or variable completion. If an API has three parameters and only the second argument expects a workspace name or variable, only the first two arguments need to be included below, with the first argument documented as `null`; the remaining argument can be omitted.
