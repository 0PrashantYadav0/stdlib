/**
* Returns a list of REPL presentation-specific commands.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Each array element is comprised as follows:
*
*     ```text
*     [ <command>, <shortcut>, <function>, <is_accessor> ]
*     ```
*
*     where the first element is the command alias, the second element is the command alias shortcut, the third element the command callback, and the fourth element a boolean indicating whether the callback is an accessor (getter; i.e., the command refers to a property rather than a function to be explicitly invoked).
*
* @private
* @param {Presentation} pres - presentation instance
* @returns {ArrayArray} commands
