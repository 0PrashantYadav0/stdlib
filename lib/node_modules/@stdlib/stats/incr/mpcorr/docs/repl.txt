{{alias}}( window[, mx, my] )
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a moving
    sample Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.

    The `window` parameter defines the number of values over which to compute
    the moving sample correlation coefficient.

    If provided values, the accumulator function returns an updated moving
    sample correlation coefficient. If not provided values, the accumulator
    function returns the current moving sample correlation coefficient.

    The first `W-1` returned sample correlation coefficients will have less
    statistical support than subsequent sample correlation coefficients, as `W`
    values are needed to fill the window buffer. Until the window is full, the
    returned sample correlation coefficient equals the sample correlation
    coefficient of all provided values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window: integer
        Window size.

    mx: number (optional)
        Known mean.

    my: number (optional)
        Known mean.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}( 3 );
    > var r = accumulator()
    null
    > r = accumulator( 2.0, 1.0 )
    0.0
    > r = accumulator( -5.0, 3.14 )
    ~-1.0
    > r = accumulator( 3.0, -1.0 )
    ~-0.925
    > r = accumulator( 5.0, -9.5 )
    ~-0.863
    > r = accumulator()
    ~-0.863
