{{alias}}( window[, mx, my] )
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a moving
    unbiased sample covariance.

    The `window` parameter defines the number of values over which to compute
    the moving unbiased sample covariance.

    If provided values, the accumulator function returns an updated moving
    unbiased sample covariance. If not provided values, the accumulator function
    returns the current moving unbiased sample covariance.

    The first `W-1` returned unbiased sample covariances will have less
    statistical support than subsequent unbiased sample covariances, as `W`
    values are needed to fill the window buffer. Until the window is full, the
    returned unbiased sample covariance equals the unbiased sample covariance of
    all provided values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window: integer
        Window size.

    mx: number (optional)
        Known mean.

    my: number (optional)
        Known mean.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}( 3 );
    > var v = accumulator()
    null
    > v = accumulator( 2.0, 1.0 )
    0.0
    > v = accumulator( -5.0, 3.14 )
    ~-7.49
    > v = accumulator( 3.0, -10.0 )
    TODO
    > v = accumulator( 5.0, -9.5 )
    TODO
    > v = accumulator()
    TODO
