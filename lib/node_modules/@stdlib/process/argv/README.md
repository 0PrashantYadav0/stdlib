## Notes

-   The first element is the absolute pathname of the executable that started the calling process.
-   The second element is the path of the executed file.
-   Any additional elements are additional command-line arguments.
-   In browser environments, `ARGV` is an **empty** array.
-   Modifications to `ARGV` are local to the process in which `ARGV` is modified.
-   Be careful when modifying command-line arguments as the argument array represents shared state. Accordingly, modifications affect all command-line argument consumers.
