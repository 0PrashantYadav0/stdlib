// TODO: why are these functions needed? And how would they be used? When would we be concerned with casting for strided array functions? I suppose if provided doubles and "unsafe" casting is allowed, then we could cast double-precision output to `float32` if provided a `float32` output array. Or, if only "same_kind" casts are allowed, then if provided integer arrays, would not be able to invoke a callback which expects doubles. It seems to me that casting is more applicable outside of element-wise interfaces (e.g., when have two arrays of different types and need to figure out a common type for performing operations and for saving the results).
