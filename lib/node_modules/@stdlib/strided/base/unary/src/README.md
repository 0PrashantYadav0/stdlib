# Unary

> Strided array functions for unary callbacks.

## Notes

-   Character codes for data types:

    -   **d**: float64 (double-precision floating-point number)
    -   **f**: float32 (single-precision floating-point number)
    -   **s**: int8 (signed 8-bit integer)
    -   **b**: uint8 (unsigned 8-bit integer)
    -   **k**: int16 (signed 16-bit integer)
    -   **t**: uint16 (unsigned 16-bit integer)
    -   **i**: int32 (signed 32-bit integer)
    -   **u**: uint32 (unsigned 32-bit integer)

-   Function name suffix naming convention:

    ```text
    <base_function_name>[_<input_data_types>]_<output_data_type>[_as_<callback_arg_data_types>_<callback_return_data_type>]
    ```

    For example,
  
    ```c
    void stdlib_strided_d_d(...) {...}
    ```

    is a function which accepts one double-precision floating-point strided input array and one double-precision floating-point strided output array. In other words, the suffix encodes the function type signature.

-   To support callbacks whose input arguments and/or return values are of a different data type than the input and/or output strided array data types, the naming convention supports appending an `as` suffix. For example,

    ```c
    void stdlib_strided_f_f_as_d_d(...) {...}
    ```

    is a function which accepts one single-precision floating-point strided input array and one single-precision floating-point strided output array. However, the callback accepts and returns double-precision floating-point numbers. Accordingly, the input and output values need to be cast using the following conversion sequence

    ```text
    // Convert each input array element to double-precision:
    float in1 -> double in1

    // Evaluate the callback:
    double out1 = f( in1 )

    // Convert the callback return value to single-precision:
    float out1 <- double out1
    ```

-   Each file contains a single strided array function. The file name matches the strided array function name suffix.

-   The implemented functions which perform conversions are **not** exhaustive and that is intentional. Namely, functions which would perform "unsafe" conversions are not included (e.g., converting an `int32` to `int16` or `double` to `int32`). If users want to perform "unsafe" conversions, that should be an conscious decision. All the machinery (e.g., macros, typedefs, etc) is available for implementing strided array functions which perform "unsafe" conversions, but we should not make this overly easy or be proactive in promoting "unsafe" conversion use.
