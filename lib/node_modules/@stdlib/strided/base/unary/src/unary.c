/**
* Strided array functions for unary callbacks.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Character codes for data types:
*
*     -   d: float64 (double)
*     -   f: float32 (float)
*     -   s: int8 (signed char)
*     -   b: uint8 (unsigned char)
*     -   k: int16 (signed short)
*     -   t: uint16 (unsigned short)
*     -   i: int32 (signed int)
*     -   u: uint32 (unsigned int)
*
* -   Function name suffix naming convention:
*
*     ```text
*     <base_function_name>[_<input_data_types>]_<output_data_type>[_as_<callback_arg_data_types>_<callback_return_data_type>]
*     ```
*
*     For example,
*
*     ```c
*     void stdlib_strided_dd_d(...) {...}
*     ```
*
*     is a function which accepts two strided input arrays containing double-precision floating-point numbers and whose results are cast as double-precision floating-point numbers. In other words, the suffix encodes the function type signature.
*
* -   To support callbacks whose input arguments and/or return values are of a different data type than the input and/or output strided array data types, the naming convention supports appending an `as` suffix. For example,
*
*     ```c
*     void stdlib_strided_ff_f_as_dd_d(...) {...}
*     ```
*
*     is a function which accepts two strided input arrays containing single-precision floating-point numbers and whose results are cast as single-precision floating-point numbers. However, the callback requires each pair of single-precision floating-point numbers be cast to double-precision floating-point numbers when provided as arguments, and the callback return value is a double-precision floating-point number. Accordingly, the conversion process would be
*
*     ```text
*     float in1 -> double in1
*     float in2 -> double in2
*     double out1 = f( in1, in2 )
*     float out1 <- double out1
*     ```
*
* -   The functions included in this file which perform conversions are **not** exhaustive and that is intentional. Namely, functions which would perform "unsafe" conversions are not included (e.g., converting an `int32` to `int16` or `double` to `int32`). If users want to perform "unsafe" conversions, that should be an conscious decision. All the machinery (e.g., macros, typedefs, etc) is available for implementing strided array functions which perform "unsafe" conversions, but we should not make this overly easy or be proactive in promoting "unsafe" conversion use.
