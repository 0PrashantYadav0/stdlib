## Usage

``` javascript
var getSpeeches = require( '@stdlib/datasets/sotu-addresses' );
```

#### getSpeeches( \[options\] )

Retrieve an `array` of all 'State of the Union' addresses given by U.S. presidents. Each address is represented as an `object` with the following keys: `text` holds the transcript of the speech, `year` denotes the year in which the speech was given, `president` refers to the president who gave the address and `party` to his party.

``` javascript
var sotu = getSpeeches();
// returns <Array>

var len = sotu.length;
// returns 288

var lastAddress = sotu[ len - 1 ];
/* returns
    {
        text: 'Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year that I\'ve come here to report on the State of the Union. (...)',
        year: 2016,
        president: 'Barack Obama',
        party: 'Democratic'
    }
*/
```

The function accepts the following `options`:

* __president__: retrieve only speeches by the given president(s). Default: ``.
* __range__: `array` with two elements giving a year range of speeches to retrieve. Default: ``.
* __party__: retrieve speeches by the presidents from the given political party/parties. Default: ``.
* __lazy__: `boolean` specifying whether data should be loaded lazily. Default: `true`.

To limit the State of the Union addresses to only those by a specific president, set the `president` option. It is also possible to supply an `array` of presidents.

``` javascript
var obamaSpeeches = getSpeeches({
	'president': 'Barack Obama'
});
// returns <Array>

var bushSpeeches = getSpeeches({
	'president': [ 'George Bush', 'George W. Bush' ]
});
// returns <Array>
```

Setting the `range` option allows one to only retrieve speeches given between the specified years.

``` javascript
var lastTenSpeeches = getSpeeches({
	'range': [ 2007, 2016 ]
});
// returns <Array>
```

By default, speeches of presidents from all political parties are returned. To retrieve only speeches made by presidents of a particular political party, set the `party` option. This option also accepts an `array` of parties. Besides `Democratic` and `Republican`, possible values are `Democratic-Republican`, `Federalist`, `None`, `National Union`, `Whig & Democratic` and `Whig`.

``` javascript
var democraticSpeeches = getSpeeches({
	'party': 'Democratic'
})
// returns <Array>
```

Under the default options, the speeches are loaded lazily. To load all speeches into memory at once even when the query is only for a subset, set the `lazy` option to `false`.

``` javascript
var obamaSpeeches = getSpeeches({
	'president': 'Barack Obama',
	'lazy': false
});
// returns <Array>
```

var getSpeeches = require( '@stdlib/datasets/sotu-addresses' );
var out;

out = getSpeeches({
	'range': [ 2005, 2008 ]

console.dir( out );
// => [ ... ]

// Get speeches by one or more presidents:
out = getSpeeches({
	'president': [ 'Ronald Reagan', 'William J. Clinton' ]
});
console.log( 'Number of SOTU addresses by Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton: %d', out.length );
// => "Number of SOTU addresses by Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton: 15"

// Get all addresses by presidents belonging to the democratic party:
out = getSpeeches({
	'party': 'Democratic'
});
console.log( 'Number of SOTU addresses by democrats: %d', out.length );
// => "Number of SOTU addresses by democrats: 89"
