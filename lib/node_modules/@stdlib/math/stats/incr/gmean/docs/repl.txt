{{alias}}()
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a geometric
    mean.

    If provided a value, the accumulator function returns an updated geometric
    mean. If not provided a value, the accumulator function returns the current
    geometric mean.

    If provided `NaN` or a value which, when used in computations, results in
    `NaN`, the accumulated value is `NaN` for all future invocations.

    For long running accumulations or accumulations of large numbers, care
    should be taken to prevent overflow. Note, however, that overflow/underflow
    may be transient, as the accumulator does not use a double-precision
    floating-point number to store intermediate values. Instead, the accumulator
    splits intermediate values into a normalized fraction and exponent and
    updates each component separately. Doing so guards against a loss in
    precision.

    If provided a negative value, the accumulated value is `NaN` for all future
    invocations.

        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}();
    > var v = accumulator()
    1.0
    > v = accumulator( 2.0 )
    2.0
    > v = accumulator( 5.0 )
    ~3.16
    > v = accumulator()
    ~3.16
