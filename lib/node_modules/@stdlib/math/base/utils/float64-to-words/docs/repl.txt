{{alias}}( x )
    Splits a floating-point number into a higher order word (unsigned 32-bit
    integer) and a lower order word (unsigned 32-bit integer).

    The function returns an array with two elements: first a higher order word
    and second a lower order word. The lower order word contains the less
    significant bits, while the higher order word contains the more significant
    bits and includes the exponent and sign.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: double
        Double-precision floating-point number.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<double>
        Two-element array containing a higher order word and a lower order word.

    Examples
    --------
    > var w = {{alias}}( 3.14e201 )
    [ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]
