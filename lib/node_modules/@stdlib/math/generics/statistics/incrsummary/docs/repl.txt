{{alias}}()
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a statistical
    summary.

    The accumulator function returns an updated summary if provided a
    value. If not provided a value, the accumulator function returns the current
    summary.

    The returned summary is an object containing the following statistics under
    the respective keys:

    - count
    - max
    - min
    - range
    - midrange
    - sum
    - mean
    - variance
    - stdev

    Input values are not type checked. If non-numeric inputs are possible, you
    are advised to type check and handle accordingly before passing the value to
    the accumulator function.

    For long running accumulations or accumulations of large numbers, care
    should be taken to prevent overflow.
