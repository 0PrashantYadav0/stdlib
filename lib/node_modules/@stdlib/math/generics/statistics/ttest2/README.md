Student's t-Test
===

> Two-sample Student's t-Test.


<!-- <usage> -->

## Usage

``` javascript
var ttest2 = require( '@stdlib/math/generics/statistics/ttest2' );
```

### ttest2( x, y[, opts] )

By default, the function performs a two-sample t-test for the null hypothesis that the data in [arrays][array] or [typed arrays][typed-array] `x` and `y` is  independently drawn from normal distributions with equal means and variances.


``` javascript

```

The returned object comes with a `.print()` method which when invoked will print a formatted output of the results of the hypothesis test.

```javascript
console.log( out.print() );
```

The function accepts the following `options`:

* 	__alpha__: `number` in the interval `[0,1]` giving the significance level of the hypothesis test. Default: `0.05`.
*	__alternative__: Either `two-sided`, `less` or `greater`. Indicates whether the alternative hypothesis is that `x` has a larger mean than `y` (`greater`), `x` has a smaller mean than `y` (`less`) or the means are the same (`two-sided`). Default: `two-sided`.
* 	__difference__: `number` denoting the difference in means under the null hypothesis. Default: `0`.
* 	__variance__: `string` indicating if the test should be conducted under the assumption that the unknown variances of the normal distributions are `equal` or `unequal`. Default: `unequal`.
