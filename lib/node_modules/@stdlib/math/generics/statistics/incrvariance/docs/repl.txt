{{alias}}()
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes an unbiased
    sample variance.

    The accumulator function returns an updated unbiased sample variance if
    provided a value. If not provided a value, the accumulator function returns
    the current unbiased sample variance.

    Input values are not type checked. If provided `NaN` or a value which, when
    used in computations, results in `NaN`, the accumulated value is `NaN` for
    all future invocations. If non-numeric inputs are possible, you are advised
    to type check and handle accordingly before passing the value to the
    accumulator function.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}();
    > var s2 = accumulator()
    0.0
    > s2 = accumulator( 2.0 )
    0.0
    > s2 = accumulator( -5.0 )
    24.5
    > s2 = accumulator()
    24.5
