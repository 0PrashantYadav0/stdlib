{{alias}}( window )
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a moving
    sum. The `window` parameter defines the number of values over
    which to compute the moving sum.

    The accumulator function returns an updated moving sum if provided a value.
    If not provided a value, the accumulator function returns the current
    moving sum.

    Input values are not type checked. If provided `NaN` or a value which, when
    used in computations, results in `NaN`, the accumulated value is `NaN` for
    all future invocations. If non-numeric inputs are possible, you are advised
    to type check and handle accordingly before passing the value to the
    accumulator function.

    The first `W-1` returned sums will have less statistical support than
    subsequent sums, as `W` values are needed to fill the window buffer.
    Until the window is full, the returned sum equals the sum of
    all provided values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window: integer
        Window size.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}( 3 );
    > var sum = accumulator()
    null
    > sum = accumulator( 2.0 )
    2.0
    > sum = accumulator( -5.0 )
    -3.0
    > sum = accumulator( 3.0 )
    0.0
    > sum = accumulator( 5.0 )
    3.0
    > sum = accumulator()
    3.0
