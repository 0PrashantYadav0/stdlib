{{alias}}( window )
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a moving
    statistical summary. The `window` parameter defines the number of values
    over which to compute the moving statistical summary.

    The accumulator function returns an updated moving statistical summary if
    provided a value. If not provided a value, the accumulator function returns
    the current moving statistical summary.

    The returned summary is an object containing the following statistics under
    the respective keys:

    - count
    - max
    - min
    - range
    - midrange
    - sum
    - mean
    - variance
    - stdev

    Input values are not type checked. If non-numeric inputs are possible, you
    are advised to type check and handle accordingly before passing the value to
    the accumulator function.

    The first `W-1` returned summaries will have less statistical support than
    subsequent summaries, as `W` values are needed to fill the window buffer.
    Until the window is full, the returned summary is computed from all provided
    values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window: integer
        Window size.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}( 3 );
    > var summary = accumulator()
    {}
    > summary = accumulator( 2.0 )
    {...}
    > summary = accumulator( -5.0 )
    {...}
    > summary = accumulator()
    {...}
