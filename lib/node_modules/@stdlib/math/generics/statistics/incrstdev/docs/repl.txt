{{alias}}()
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a corrected
    sample standard deviation.

    The accumulator function returns an updated corrected sample standard
    deviation if provided a value. If not provided a value, the accumulator
    function returns the current corrected sample standard deviation.

    Input values are not type checked. If provided `NaN` or a value which, when
    used in computations, results in `NaN`, the accumulated value is `NaN` for
    all future invocations. If non-numeric inputs are possible, you are advised
    to type check and handle accordingly before passing the value to the
    accumulator function.

    > s = accumulator( 2.0 )
    0.0
    > s = accumulator( -5.0 )
    ~4.95
    > s = accumulator()
    ~4.95
