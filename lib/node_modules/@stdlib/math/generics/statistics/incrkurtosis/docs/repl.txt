{{alias}}()
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a corrected
    sample excess kurtosis.

    The accumulator function returns an updated corrected sample excess kurtosis
    if provided a value. If not provided a value, the accumulator function
    returns the current corrected sample excess kurtosis.

    Input values are not type checked. If provided `NaN` or a value which, when
    used in computations, results in `NaN`, the accumulated value is `NaN` for
    all future invocations. If non-numeric inputs are possible, you are advised
    to type check and handle accordingly before passing the value to the
    accumulator function.

    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}();
    > var kurtosis = accumulator( 2.0 )
    null
    > kurtosis = accumulator( 2.0 )
    null
    > kurtosis = accumulator( -4.0 )
    null
    > kurtosis = accumulator( -4.0 )
    -6.0
