/**
* Returns an object mapping supported dtypes to integer values for purposes of C inter-operation.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Downstream consumers of this mapping should **not** rely on specific integer values (e.g., `INT8 == 0`). Instead, the object should be used in an opaque manner.
* -   The main purpose of this function is JavaScript and C inter-operation of ndarray objects. While certain dtypes, such as "generic" and "binary", have special behavior in JavaScript, they do not have a direct complement in C.
*
* @returns {Object} object mapping supported dtypes to integer values
*
* @example
* var table = enumerated();
* // returns <Object>
