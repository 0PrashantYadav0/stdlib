{{alias}}( arr, shape )
    Broadcasts an ndarray to a specified shape.

    The returned array is a view on the input array data buffer. The view is
    typically **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view
    may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect
    multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned array, copy the
    array before performing operations which may mutate elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ndarray
        Input array.

    shape: ArrayLikeObject
        Desired shape.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Broadcasted array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] )
    <ndarray>
    > var sh = x.shape
    [ 2, 2 ]
    > var y = {{alias}}( x, [ 3, 2, 2 ] )
    <ndarray>
    > sh = y.shape
    [ 3, 2, 2 ]
    > var v = y.get( 0, 0, 0 )
    1
    > v = y.get( 0, 0, 1 )
    2
    > v = y.get( 0, 1, 0 )
    3
    > v = y.get( 0, 1, 1 )
    4
    > v = y.get( 1, 0, 0 )
    1
    > v = y.get( 1, 1, 0 )
    3
    > v = y.get( 2, 0, 0 )
    1
    > v = y.get( 2, 1, 1 )
    4
