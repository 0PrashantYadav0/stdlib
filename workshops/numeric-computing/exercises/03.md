# REPL

> This exercise covers using a REPL for numeric computing.


## Exercises

### a) Getting Started

* Launch a REPL from the top-level `stdlib` directory.

  ``` bash
  $ cd ./path/to/stdlib-js/stdlib
  $ make repl
  ```

* To see a list of REPL functions, hit the `TAB` key.
* Create a linearly spaced `1001` element vector from `0` to `1` using [linspace][linspace].
* To retrieve the last value, type `_` and hit `ENTER`.


### b) Plotting

* Generate a plot of [`erf`][erf] over the interval `[-10,10]`.
* Generate a column chart [sparkline][sparkline]. Note that `ColumnChart` is aliased as `Sparkline` in the REPL.
* Simulate `10000` pseudorandom [uniform][randu] numbers, bin the numbers into `101` __equally__ spaced (see [linspace][linspace]) bins from `0` to `1`, and generate a sparkline showing the bin counts.


### c) Scripts

* Require one of your previous solutions; e.g., 

  ```
  > require( './workshops/numeric-computing/solutions/02.e.js' );
  ```

## Tips

* When generating a sparkline for `randu` counts, be sure to set `yMin`. If not set, counts will appear less uniform than they actually are.
