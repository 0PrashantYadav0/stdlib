# Native Math

> This exercise covers built-in JavaScript Math functions.

## Exercises

### 1) Plotting

-   Generate a plot of `Math.sin` over the interval `[0,2π]`.
-   Generate a plot of `Math.cos` over the interval `[0,2π]`.

### 2) RMSE

A common measure of numerical accuracy is the [root-mean-square error][rmse] (RMSE). The basic idea is to determine the average deviation of computed values from a known standard. The lower the RMSE, the more accurate the algorithm; the higher the RMSE, the less accurate the algorithm.

-   Write a function to compute the [root-mean-square error][rmse] (RMSE).

### 3) Comparison to Standard

-   Generate a plot showing the sine computed by `Math.sin` and the sine computed from Julia (Julia results can be found in the `./fixtures` directory). The `x` values over which to compute the sin are included in the fixtures.
-   Generate a plot showing the deviations (in units of [epsilon][@stdlib/math/base/utils/float64-epsilon-difference]) of `Math.sin` from Julia (include the RMSE in the plot title).
-   As a bonus, repeat the test for different Node versions.

### 4) Testing Native Math

-   Extend the previous solutions to test the following Math functions:

    -   `cos`
    -   `tan`
    -   `sqrt`
    -   `pow`
    -   `exp`
    -   `log`

    The output should be a single web page showing the deviations in units of epsilon for **all** functions.

-   As a bonus, repeat the tests for different browsers, such as Firefox and Internet Explorer.

### 5) Testing Custom Implementations

-   Extend the previous solution to test custom implementations of the above functions.

    -   `sin`: `@stdlib/math/base/special/sin`
    -   `cos`: `@stdlib/math/base/special/cos`
    -   `tan`: `@stdlib/math/base/special/tan`
    -   `sqrt`: `@stdlib/math/base/special/sqrt`
    -   `log`: `@stdlib/math/base/special/ln`
    -   `exp`: `@stdlib/math/base/special/exp`
    -   `pow`: `@stdlib/math/base/special/pow`

## Tips

-   When calculating the [RMSE][rmse], consider using [Welford's method][welfords-method] for robust computation of the mean.
-   When generating plots, be sure to specify plot axis labels and the plot title.
-   To test against different Node versions, use [nvm][nvm].
-   Testing different browsers may be rather involved. One possible solution would be to launch a browser, load a test script which runs the computations, and then stream the results back to an analysis server which collects the results and generates a plot.

## Testing

Assuming that each solution is placed in a separate file,

```bash
$ node ./path/to/<solution_1>.js
$ node ./path/to/<solution_2>.js
# ...
```

When all your solutions succeed, proceed to the [next exercise][next-exercise].
