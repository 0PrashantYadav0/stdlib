# Simulating Markov Chains

> This exercise covers reproducible simulation, with extension to [discrete-time Markov chains][markov-chain].


## Exercises

### 1) Coin-flipping

* Simulate `100` coin flips of a fair-sided coin and determine the longest streak of heads and the longest streak of tails.
* Simulate `100` coin flips of an unfair coin, where the probability of getting heads is `0.7` and the probability of getting tails is `0.3`. Determine the longest streak of heads and the longest streak of tails.


### 2) Markov Chain

* Given the following initial probability `array` and transition probability `matrix`, simulate the first `100` steps of a [discrete-time Markov chain][markov-chain].

  ``` javascript
  var initial = [ 0.2, 0.8 ]; // sums to unity
  var transition = [
      [ 0.3, 0.7 ], // sums to unity
      [ 0.4, 0.6 ]  // sums to unity
  ];
  ```

  The output should be a `101` element state vector; e.g., `[1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,...]`, where the first element is the initial state.

* As a bonus, extend the simulation to `5` states and `1000` steps and plot the state vector.


### 3) Model Generation

* Download and process a training corpus.

  - Download a full plain text copy of [Moby Dick][moby-dick] from [Project Gutenberg][moby-dick].
  - Remove the front matter before `Chapter 1`, and remove the end matter after the `Epilogue`.
  - Replace all tab characters with a single space.
  - Replace all newline characters (and trailing spaces) with a single space.
  - Replace multiple spaces with a single space.
  - Split the text into separate "words" using a single space as the delimiter.
  - Write the word list to file.
  - Build a database (dictionary) where each key is a pair of consecutive words and the key value is an `array` of words which follow the key pair. For example, given the phrase "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy cat.", the database would be

    ``` javascript
    var dict = {
        'The quick': ['brown'],
        'quick brown': ['fox'],
        'brown fox': ['jumped'],
        'fox jumped': ['over'],
        'jumped over': ['the'],
        'over the': ['lazy'],
        'the lazy': ['cat.']    
    };
    ```

  - Write the database to file as JSON.


#### 4) Text Generation

* Using the database and word list from above, create a function to generate text having a maximum word length of `25`. Hints:

  - First seed the text generator with two words from the word list.
  - Look up the list of possible third words in the database and randomly pick one of them.
  - Next, use the second and third words to find a fourth word, and so on and so forth.
  - Stop once you have generated the desired number of words.


## Tips

* Use `123456` to seed [randu][randu], thus allowing comparison with solution results.
* When processing the training corpus, consider using streams (e.g., [split][split], [join][join], and [transform][trasnform]) for efficient processing.
* To select a random element from a list,

  ``` javascript
  var randu = require( '@stdlib/math/base/random/randu' );
  var floor = require( '@stdlib/math/base/random/randu' );

  var list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];

  // Generate a random index:
  var i = floor( randu()*list.length );
  ```


## Testing

Assuming that each solution is placed in a separate file,

``` bash
$ node ./path/to/<solution_1>.js
$ node ./path/to/<solution_2>.js
# ...
```

When all your solutions pass, proceed to the [next exercise][next-exercise].
