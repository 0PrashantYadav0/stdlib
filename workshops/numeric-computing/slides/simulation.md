# Simulation

> Process of creating and analyzing a digital prototype of a model to predict performance in the physical world.

---

# Why?

* Aid understanding of both assumptions and effects.
* Probe edge cases.
* Limited by computational power, not acquisition.

---

# Model

> A set of assumptions regarding sample data generation, with extension to a larger data population.

---

# Example

* Weather

---

# Markov Process

> Model for a system that changes state according to a transition rule that depends on only the current state.

---

# Markov Chain

> A sequence of states through which a Markov process moves.

---

# Markov Chain Simulation

* Initial probability vector
* Transition probability matrix

---

# Algorithm

1. Randomly choose an initial state.
2. Randomly choose the next state.
3. Repeat (2).

---

# Applications

* Mathematics
* Statistics
* Finance
* Speech recognition
* Time series analysis
* Search engines (PageRank)
* Text generators
